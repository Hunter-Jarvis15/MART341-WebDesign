The world wide web are the pages you see when you're at a device and you're online. 
But the internet is the network of connected computers that the web works on, as well as what emails and files travel across.

The Internet simply moves data from one place to another, so that we can chat, browse and share. Data moves over the Internet in a manner called “packet switching.” 
What packet switching basically does is it sends your data in separate pieces – each tagged with your intended destination.

Directory Also known as a "folder", a directory is a collection of files typically created for organizational purposes. A directory allows files to communicate with each other 
and where they come from via parent folder and child folder.

My favorite kind of art would have to be cartoon style art. What I mean by that is it has outlines and looks almost like disney made it. If you look up "cartoon art" and go to
images you'll see kind of what I mean.
