13. There can only be One <head> and One <body> element per page. The <head> element is a container for processing information and document metadata. The <head> contains high-level information about the site, and always comes first within the root element. In this sense, we can consider the <head> to contain the thoughts of the page. The body element is where all of the site gets placed. This is the data that is rendered by the browser and displayed on the client's local computer.
14. Structural Markups change the way the page reads. It guides the viewer through the page. These often include elements such as Heading, Paragraphs, Breaks, and Lists. Semantic Markups are used to reinforce information of the page. These elements include Bold, Italics, super and sub script, etc.
15. For this assignment I first opened the week 6 module on the website then opened the PDF of the homework to know what I needed to work towards. The homework PDF tells me what I need to learn to make a website specified by the PDF. Basically I learn as a go and complete the homework. For example I looked at step 2 and realized "I don't know what Meta Elements are" so I go to the week 6 module and learn about them and put then into my code. This process happens for each step of the homework I don't know immediately.
