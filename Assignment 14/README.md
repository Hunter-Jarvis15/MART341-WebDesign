1. My client was an artist who creates their work in many different mediums. They wanted a site that had some simple colors but also had some rich color in certain areas like the Navigation bar.

2. A mobile-first design is important because you want people to visit your site from wherever, and since everyone now a days has a smartphone that they can access it on, you want it to mobile friendly and easy to use.

3. Other than my assignment being late, I didn't really struggle with my site to much. I looked at your example to get an idea of what I wanted to do with my own and you had some code that I was unfamiliar with so I had to look it up. The hardest piece I would say was understanding the dropdown box in the navigation header, but after looking at your code and some tutorials it made more sense.
