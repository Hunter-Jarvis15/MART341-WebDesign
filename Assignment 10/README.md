1. The universal selector is used to style every element on a page with the use of an (*). The element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type. This selector is applied by simply using an element name for example:
body{
  color: blue;
}
Class selectors are class names assigned to HTML elements via the class="" attribute can also be used to style elements. To select class elements, prepend a dot (.) to the front of the class name in the CSS. Using class selectors is a great way to select elements that serve the same function.
Just like the class selector, the ID selector allows developers to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID. ID names are prepended with a number sign (#).

I think it's important to use a universal/ element selector when making a webpage to keep all the pages consistent in terms of style so there is any confusion within the website. Class selectors and ID selector are good for individual parts of the webpage. You can change individual divs and spans inside of them to all do something different if you choose.

2. I chose to go with the decade of the 80s and talked about to rock bands of that era, Guns N' Roses and Kiss. I decided to back the background a lighter yellow with a border of red to mimic the GnR's logo while having the text stay black to read, but I broke up the divs with a silver line to get more of Kiss's colors considering there was black text.

3. I didn't really have any problems, but I did quickly realize that there's a lot of customization within a stylesheet and it was fun trying to explore new ways to create a webpage.
