1.  Fonts like Arial and Times New Roman, are deemed “web-safe” or “email-safe” because they are installed by default on just about every computer, device, and operating system there is.

Web-Safe fonts should not be confused with Web fonts. Web fonts are not installed on every operating system and device. That said, oftentimes, you’ll find Web fonts are embedded into web browsers and downloaded into a user’s browser through rendering and applied to text.

2. The browser will try to use the font you specified first, but if it doesn’t have that font available, it will keep going down the list of fonts you specified until one works.

3. As this weeks lesson being more font and design focused, I had a hard time figuring where the font family tag needed to go in order to have them show up properly. After some tinkering around in my code and looking at your example it made more sense and I got it to work.
